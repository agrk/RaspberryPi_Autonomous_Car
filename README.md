# RaspberryPi_Autonomous_Car

Self Driving Car / Graduation Thesis Project


- Autonomous vehicle development work that completes the track with Lane Detection, Stop Sign Detection and Car Detection.
- The car was developed using Arduino and Raspberry Pi with the openCV library and tested in a simulated environment.


You can find the links for the videos about the self driving car here:
- Detect the car in front and keep moving in the left lane: https://youtu.be/XHu5VRzVWwg
- Passing in front of the detected car, continue to move on the right lane https://youtu.be/Et18lR2VIXI
